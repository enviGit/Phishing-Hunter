## 📂 About

**Phishing Hunter** is an educational game built with Unity, set in a simulated office environment. As a cybersecurity analyst, your core challenges are to identify suspicious emails (phishing), solve real-world security quizzes, and progress your virtual career by learning the fundamentals of digital hygiene.

The project is designed to promote cyber awareness and foster safe online habits in an engaging, interactive way. Developed as part of a diploma project.
